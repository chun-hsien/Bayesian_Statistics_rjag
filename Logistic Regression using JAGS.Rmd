### Lesson 9 Logistic regression
#### Lesson 9.2 
#### Data
Load package
```{r}
library("boot")
data("urine")
?urine
head(urine)
```
Before we conduct analysis, let's remove those missing values.
```{r}
dat = na.omit(urine)
dim(dat)
```
Let's look at a pairs scatterplot for each of the seven variables.
```{r}
pairs(dat)
```
One thing that stands out is that several of theses variables are strongly correlated with one another. For example, `osmo` and `gravity` appear to have a very close linear relationship. Collinearity between $$x$$ variables in linear regression models can cause truoube in statistical inference.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

`echo = FALSE`
